# WORLDROAMERS.

This website is for those who want more. Not necessarily money, wealth, but something far more valuable than those things. I'm talking about experiences. 

You will be able to read about other people perspective of a certain place, maybe even interact with them and ask for advice if you sign up. There is a gallery section in which pictures will be displayed, showing the beauty of the world. You can access instagram, twitter and youtube from the website footer.

## Bugs

* Bugs Fixed:
    * **Background Image.** Wanted to give an opacity to this image. But I couldn't make the image opaque and the text solid or not opaque.So instead an IMG html element was added.
    * **Text not on top of IMG**. I wanted to display text on top of an opaque img, and it took me a while to figure out. I had to play with the position and used a CSS property called transform. I used stack overflow to get through this. 
* Known bugs:
    * Form is not getting submitted on the deployed page, but it works when I run the website from the IDE. This might be due to the action of the form. Perhaps I need to use an absolute path insted of the relative path.
