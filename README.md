# WORLDROAMERS.

This website is for those who want more. Not necessarily money, wealth, but something far more valuable than those things. I'm talking about experiences. 

You will be able to read about other people perspective of a certain place, maybe even interact with them and ask for advice if you sign up. There is a gallery section in which pictures will be displayed, showing the beauty of the world. You can access instagram, twitter and youtube from the website footer.

## Bugs

* Bugs Fixed:
    * **Background Image.** Wanted to give an opacity to the background image. By doing this, elements inside the parent container were opaque as well. Added an IMG element in the html insted of using a backgroung property in the css file.
    * **Text not on top of IMG.** IMG element pushed down my other elements as its a block element. Did some research and in stack overflow found a solution using the transform property and playing with the elements position.   
    * **Form not submitting**. Wrong path used, a slash in front of the html name page. E.g /signed.html. Removed slash and worked properly.
